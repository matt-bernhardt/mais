## About the name

[Brian Maisonneuve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Maisonneuve) - nicknamed "Mais" - played midfield for the Columbus Crew
and US National team from 1996 through 2004. He was a member of the 1998 US
World Cup team, appearing in all three games.

During his playing career, Mais developed a reputation as a player with great
awareness of the field, and was able to anticipate plays with an uncanny
regularity. This skillset makes him a suitable inspiration for a tool that
attempts to predict soccer games.
